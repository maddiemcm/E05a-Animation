# E05a-Animation

We will begin to explore keyboard and mouse control in a Python Arcade program.

main1.py contains code that follows mouse movement with a ball that is defined in the code and changes colors when the mouse is clicked or released.


main2.py contains code that follows keyboard movements with a ball that reacts to the left, right, up and down keys along their designated axises. It designates how fast the ball moves and how it interacts with the screen barriers.
